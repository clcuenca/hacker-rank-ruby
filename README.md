## Description

Collection of various Hacker Rank problems written in Ruby.

## Structure

This repository aims to keep each category & sub categories in their own directory to reflect the structure of Hacker Rank's problem sets; e.g. algorithms -> warmup -> *problem*. Each problem will compile & able to be ran on the command line as well as, include a makefile & input.txt file to display the results. Each program is designed to consume the included input file.

The following command is used to execute each of the programs:

```bash
ruby <program name>.rb < input.txt
```
