## Program Execution

All programs are listed in their own directory, and within the directory there is in input.txt file
included. The input.txt file contains test cases, and allows for additional test cases to be appended to the file.
Each of the programs has support for stdin (so far) and can be used with input redirection to execute through all
of the test cases, so the only thing that should be edited is the input.txt file itself. To run a program use a terminal/console and type in the following within the corresponding directory:

```ruby
ruby <script_name>.rb < input.txt
```

So far this has been tested with cygwin, but the principle should hold for macOS & linux systems.
